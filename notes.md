# Notes

## Unit tests vs functional tests

### Unit tests

- complex logic in shared function with many edge cases
- determining why functional test failed

### Functional tests

- simulates how users will use the system
- high level means not tied to implementation so easier to refactor
- resilient to changes in implementation
- can be used to test the system as a whole
- can be difficult to diagnose why a test failed
